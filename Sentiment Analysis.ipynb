I feel, is the best camera out there for the features and price. I had initially thought of buying a 2 or 3 megapixel camera but these are good for 4x6\" or 5x7\" prints and i wanted some really great 8x10\" photos once in a while. I did not want a very small camera as it seems to get lost in my hands and i was not comfortable with that. I wanted a decent sized camera with a contour for my fingers to hold it steadily. I wanted a camera that had a lot of built-in settings for different types of surroundings while giving me an option to use my photography skills although, I am an amateur with an interest in photography by turning on the manual settings. I wanted a respected brand and had to stay within my budget because i had bought an expensive camcorder before but had not used it much. Depending on all the above requirements, I had narrowed down my search to nikon 4300 and canon powershot s400 models. Nikon got the final nod for its settings auto and manual along with movie modes, medium; compact size, price, brand name, good software that is included and previous reviews. I should say I have been very happy with my decision ever since. The pictures are absolutely amazing - the camera captures the minutest of details.']]"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":37}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"ODfXFQTZE_Hd","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":581},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1598081676538,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":528,"user":{"displayName":"Aman Srivastava","photoUrl":"","userId":"01146865261047800603"}},"outputId":"f394b88a-a93e-44ac-8b4c-6c9133864e27"},"source":["for review in comments:\n","  print(\"\\n\")\n","  print(np.average(sentiment_value(str(review))))\n","  print(review)"],"execution_count":39,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["\n","\n","0.6\n","[\"This camera is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer.

It became stuck which makes it almost impossible to switch between modes. I send my camera to nikon for servicing, took them a whole 6 weeks to diagnose the problem. Worse of all, they claim that it's some kind of internal damage and refuse to cover the cost via warranty! They wouldn't repair my camera unless if i pay $100 for parts? and labor! It is a good camera in terms of the function and quality, but take your chance with it because nikon absolutely sucks when it comes to customer service.\"]\n","\n","\n","0.0\n","['Got a \"system error\" problem 30 days after purchase. Made the camera totally inoperable. Also, the lens cap design is flawed. You have to manually Audio on video also lacking. Otherwise, it takes very good pictures; shutter delay is not so bad either. Still, had to send it back to nikon for repair.']\n","\n","\n","0.45454545454545453\n","['I am an amateur photographer and here is a piece of advise to all the folks who are thinking about making a move the digital world. I feel, is the best camera out there for the features and price. I had initially thought of buying a 2 or 3 megapixel camera but these are good for 4x6\" or 5x7\" prints and i wanted some really great 8x10\" photos once in a while. I did not want a very small camera as it seems to get lost in my hands and i was not comfortable with that. I wanted a decent sized camera with a contour for my fingers to hold it steadily. I wanted a camera that had a lot of built-in settings for different types of surroundings while giving me an option to use my photography skills although, I am an amateur with an interest in photography by turning on the manual settings. I wanted a respected brand and had to stay within my budget because i had bought an expensive camcorder before but had not used it much. Depending on all the above requirements, I had narrowed down my search to nikon 4300 and canon powershot s400 models. Nikon got the final nod for its settings auto and manual along with movie modes, medium; compact size, price, brand name, good software that is included and previous reviews. I should say I have been very happy with my decision ever since. The pictures are absolutely amazing - the camera captures the minutest of details.']\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"DbcwhyubFusq","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
